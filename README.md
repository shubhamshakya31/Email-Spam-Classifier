# Email-Spam-Classifier
This project is an email classification system designed to distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) emails. The model leverages the Naive Bayes algorithm and TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. Throughout the project, various methods were explored, including CountVectorizer and TF-IDF vectorizer, along with different Naive Bayes variants such as GaussianNB, MultinomialNB, and BernoulliNB. The best RÂ² score was achieved using the TF-IDF vectorizer in combination with the MultinomialNB classifier.

Project Overview
-Data Cleaning: Initial step to remove irrelevant data, correct errors, and handle missing values.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize the data to understand its distribution and characteristics.
-Data Preprocessing: Transform and prepare the data for feature extraction and model training.
-Feature Extraction: Use TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert the text data into numerical format, representing the importance of words.
-Model Training: Train the Naive Bayes classifier, with MultinomialNB showing the best performance, to predict whether an email is spam or ham.

Features
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts textual data into numerical vectors for model input.
Naive Bayes Classifier: A probabilistic model used for classification tasks, with MultinomialNB achieving the best results.
